# Battery 18650 Stats

Library to keeps easy to obtain 18650 (battery) charge level in Arduino environment.

This lib was made on top of [Pangodream 18650CL](https://github.com/pangodream/18650CL)

## Compatibility

This Lib theoretically compatible with any ESP that has ACP pins and a 18650 Battery. It's tested with:

- [x] [LILYGO-T-Energy (T18)](https://github.com/LilyGO/LILYGO-T-Energy)

## Usage

### Import and setup
To use this Lib, you need to import and setup:
```cpp
#include <Battery18650Stats.h>

// #define ADC_PIN 35 
// #define CONVERSION_FACTOR 1.7 
// #define READS 5 

Battery18650Stats battery();
// Battery18650Stats battery(ADC_PIN);
// Battery18650Stats battery(ADC_PIN, CONVERSION_FACTOR);
// Battery18650Stats battery(ADC_PIN, CONVERSION_FACTOR, READS);
```

Constructor parameters:
```cpp
Battery18650Stats(<adc_pin>, <conversion_factor>, <reads>);
```

- `adc_pin` (optional): The ADC Pin that lib will read (analogRead) to calculate charge level. Can be obtained at device datasheet. Default Value: `35`;
- `conversion_factor` (optional): Value used to convert ADC pin reading in real battery voltage. This value can be obtained through comparisons between code result and a voltmeter result. Default Value: `1.702`;
- `reads` (optional): Quantity of reads to get an average of pin readings. Its used due pin reading instabilities. Default Value: `20`;

### Methods

After the installation and instantiation, we are able to obtain the charge level and current battery voltage.

#### Method `double getBatteryVolts()`
Returns the current battery voltage.

#### Method `int getBatteryChargeLevel(bool useConversionTable = false)`
Returns the current battery charge level.
  - Parameter `bool useConversionTable`: Indicates if the internal charge level will be obtained using the internal predefined conversion table instead the formula (default). Default value: `false`
> Attention! Using predefined conversion table will consume more RAM than using the formula.

### Usage example
```cpp
#include <Battery18650Stats.h>

Battery18650Stats battery(35);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.print("Volts: ");
  Serial.println(battery.getBatteryVolts());
	
  Serial.print("Charge level: ");
  Serial.println(battery.getBatteryChargeLevel());
  
  Serial.print("Charge level (using the reference table): ");
  Serial.println(battery.getBatteryChargeLevel(true));
}

void loop {
  //
}
```

## Troubleshoot and Finding Conversion Factor
Sometimes the result of `getBatteryChargeLevel` and `getBatteryVolts` may not represents the real state of the battery.

There are two main problems that could be happening:
- Your code is using the wrong ADC port or
- Your code is using the wrong conversion factor.

### Finding the right ADC port
You can find the ADC ports in the device datasheet. The port can change according to the hardware you are using.

### Finding the right conversion factor
To find the right conversion factor you will need a voltmeter.

Steps:
1. Measure the voltage of the battery with the voltmeter
2. Print the voltage obtained by the lib through `getBatteryVolts` method

If the measurements (library and voltmeter) match, the conversion factor is right.
If they are different, you will need to increment or decrement the conversion factor until the measurements match.
